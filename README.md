API
===

The following options are available:

### Collapsible
If set to 'true' the panels are collapsible. The values 'tabs' and 'accordion' can be used to make the panels collapsible in a specific view/state. If a tab is active and you select it again, the panel will collapse.
```javascript
collapsible: false // The panels are not collapsible
collapsible: true // The panels are collapsible
collapsible: 'tabs' // The panels are only collapsible if the view is currently tab based
collapsible: 'accordion' // The panels are only collapsible if the view is currently accordion based
```

### Start collapsed
This option defines if the first panel on load starts collapsed or not. With the values 'tabs' and 'accordion' you can specify in which view the tabs are supposed to start collapsed.

```javascript
startCollapsed: false // Do not collapse on start
startCollapsed: true // Start with the panels collapsed
startCollapsed: 'tabs' // Start with the panels collapsed if the view is currently tab based
startCollapsed: 'accordion' // Start with the panels collapsed if the view is currently accordion based
```

### Disabled tabs
An array with zero based integers that define the tabs that should be disabled

```javascript
disabled: [0,2] // Disables the first and third tab
```

### Active tab
An 0 based integer that defines the initial opened tab on load.

```javascript
active: 1 // Opens the second tab on load
```

### Accordion Tab HTML element
A single HTML element template in which the accordion tab will be wrapped.

```javascript
accordionTabElement: '<div></div>'
```

### Set hash
A boolean that can be used to enable and disable the setting of a reference to the selected tab in the URL hash. If set to 'true', the selecting of a new tab will set the reference to that tab in the URL hash.

```javascript
setHash: true
```

### Rotate
This option can be used to auto rotate the tabs. The tabs will stop rotating when a tab is selected.

```javascript
rotate: false, // The tabs won't auto rotate
rotate: true, // The tabs will auto rotate from the start
```

### Event
This option can be used to specify the event that activates a tab. For instance: 'mouseover'. Defaults to 'click'

```javascript
event: 'click' // (default) The tabs will activate on click
event: 'mouseover' // The tabs will activate on mouseover
etc...
```

### Animation
This option enables the animation of the panels. By default the panels will just show and hide, this option can be used to make the panels slide up and down and fade in and out.

```javascript
animation: 'fade', // The panels will fade in and out
animation: 'slide', // The panels will slide up and down
```

You can enable / disable the queueing of the animation by setting the ```animationQueue``` option.

```javascript
animationQueue: false, // (default) disables the queueing of the animations. With this option on, all animations happen at the same time
animationQueue: true, // enables the queueing of the animations. With this option on, animations wait for each other
animationQueue: 'tabs', // enables the queueing of the animations for the tabs state only
animationQueue: 'accordion', // enables the queueing of the animations for the accordion state only
```

You can set the speed of the animation by setting the ```duration``` option.
```javascript
duration: 500, // (default) Sets the animation duration to 500
```

### Scroll to Accordion panel
This options can be used to enable automatic scrolling to the accordion panel that has been opened

```javascript
scrollToAccordion: false, // (default) disables the auto scrolling to the accordion panel
scrollToAccordion: true, // enables the auto scrolling to the accordion panel
```

### Scroll to Accordion panel on load
This option can be used to disabling the scrolling to an accordion panel on load

```javascript
scrollToAccordionOnLoad: true, // (default) enables scrolling to accordion on load
scrollToAccordionOnLoad: false, // disables scrolling to accordion on load
```

You can define an offset in pixels for the scroll to accordion panel by setting the ```scrollToAccordionOffset``` option.

```javascript
scrollToAccordionOffset: false, // (default) disables the auto scrolling to the accordion panel
scrollToAccordionOffset: true, // enables the auto scrolling to the accordion panel
```
